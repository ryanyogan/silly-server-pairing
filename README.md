## Building out a full stack app in TypeScript, React, Node, and Apollo (GraphQL)

## Today

- MongoDB (NoSql Store)
- Modularization patterns in the JavaScript eco-system
- Create React App (we will use a generator finnaly)
- OverView of React (and how it coorelates to things such as Phoenix liveView, they copied it)
- Wiring up the GraphQL Apollo Client to react
- Styling
- Maybe... optomistic UI :)
